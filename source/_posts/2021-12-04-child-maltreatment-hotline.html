            <h1>Child Maltreatment Hotline</h1>

            <p>Following the increased volume of child maltreatment cases during the Covid-19 pandemic, and in light of
                limited
                resources, a Special Committee seeks input from various stakeholders on the design of an automated
                decision system (ADS)
                using machine learning for identifying children at risk of maltreatment.
                The screening system will focus on calls placed to a hotline, where information of child maltreatment is
                disclosed to
                social-worker interns.


            <p>Based on the call and on additional information logged in the system or pulled from government and
                public databases, the
                system will decide which calls to write off as not requiring any additional action, and which calls to
                flag as requiring
                an additional investigation to be performed by a certified social worker.

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Ground Truth</h3>

            <p>In our data, about 30% of the children are at risk <wee class='sick'>a</wee>, meaning will be removed
                from home by the child protection agency within two years from the call. actually have the disease;
                half of them don't <wee class='well'>b</wee>.
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Model Predictions</h3>

            <p>In a perfect world, only calls about children at risk would be <bg class='sick'>flagged at risk</bg> and
                requiring an
                additional investigation to be performed by a certified social worker and only
                calls about children not at risk would be <bg>flagged at no risk</bg>.
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Model Mistakes</h3>

            <p>But models (and also humans) aren't perfect.

            <p>The model might make a mistake and not flag a child who is at risk <wee class='sick bg-well'>c</wee>.

            <p>Or the opposite: flagging child at risk <wee class='well bg-sick'>f</wee>, although no additional
                invistigation is required.
        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>Never Miss Child at Risk...</h3>

            <p>One one hand, we could have the model aggressively call close cases so it rarely
                misses the child at risk.

            <p>We can evalute this model by counting the number of children who correctly and incorreclty flagget at
                risk.

            <div class='metrics'></div>

        </div>


        <div>
            <h3>... Or Avoid Unnecessary Investigations?</h3>

            <p>On the other hand, certified soical worker would be allocated to cases where no further inversitagtion is
                rquired.

            <div class='metrics'></div>

            <p>These issues and trade-offs in model optimization aren't new, but they're brought into focus when we have
                the ability to fine-tune exactly how aggressively child is flagged for risk.

        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Improve Prediction Power</h3>

            <p>Sometimes it is useful to gather additional data to improve the predictive power of the model.
            <p>But do all data sources contribute equally? What there meaning in terms of rights and values?
